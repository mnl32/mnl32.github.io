    <h2>Work In Progress 2</h2>
    <p>This work in progress was definitely more challenging for me than the last WIP. I am still struggling with the HTML and CSS (albeit less so), and I’ve never used photoshop before. With that said, I am proud of the progress I’ve made and how much I’ve learned so far. 
	One of the things I struggled with was trying to figure out how to insert images into my webpage. I had my images file in the wrong place, then I couldn’t figure out how to code up a level or two that I needed to. For most of what I tried, the alt name kept coming up with only a small image icon next to it, instead of the actual image I was trying to input. I eventually figured it out (with help!) and was able to code the HTML the right way so the image showed up in the website. 
	One thing I did during this WIP is I completely changed the CSS of my website. It used to be this gray/red blur that didn’t really mesh well or look very put together. I also did not like how the menu bar was vertical, I felt it was taking up a lot of room in the center of the page, so it looked unorganized. I deleted my current CSS and decided to start it over, which took a lot more time than I was expecting because I forgot some of the small details needed for CSS and couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t work on my website properly. I eventually settled back on a plain white background, just because everything looks cleaner on a white background, and the gray one I had did not look as good as I wanted it to. I made the menu bar horizontal and centered. I settled on a light purple as my font color, because purple is my favorite color. I liked using red as the font color because it is a bold choice, but I just could not come up with a design that looked professional and cute. The turquoise I chose for the hover color of the menu really pops against the pastel purple, in a way I think is not unprofessional and too in-your-face, like the red was. 
	Something I want to work on before the final submission of the website is changing the size of the images that are on the website. Right now, they are huge and take up a large majority of the space on the page, and you have to scroll to see the whole thing. I would also like to play around more with the CSS, focusing on the fonts next time. 
	Another thing I struggled with, as I am sure many people also did, was the abrupt departure from Pittsburgh back to my hometown. I was unprepared and have quickly learned that Zoom learning is not my preferred education style. I also have had to make do with a much slower, very lagging, version of photoshop. I am using it on my mac and have to go through Pitt’s virtual labs in order to access photoshop. My computer isn’t very compatible with it, so it won’t let me do a lot of basic tasks through photoshop, or insert anything, or even separate the layers. This added to the fact that I have very unreliable internet at my house just did not end up working well. I was fortunate in that I had the first two photoshop assignments done and uploaded to Box so I could just upload them straight from Box to Github. The logo and the storyboard, however, were incomplete and photoshop would not allow me to upload them, so I had to start over. This led to both my logo and my storyboard being less designed and complex than I would have liked, but overall, I think they turned out ok.
	Due to the events of the last few weeks, I am not sure if this work in progress submission is up to the level I had wanted it to be at this point, but I still think I did the best of my ability. HTML and CSS are definitely not things that come easily to me, or something I understand very well, but I am definitely miles ahead of where I started from at the beginning of the semester. I am hopeful that by the final submission I will be more confidant in my HTML, and not need as much as help. I also hope to have a finalized design concept that I am happy with.
