        <h3>Showcases and Reflections</h3>
        <p>1. Soundscape Activity</p>
          <p>For my soundscape, I chose to create something with a sci-fi/outer space element. I had never used Audacity before, so trying to learn how to use it remotely was slightly overwhelming for me at first. Once I got the hang of it, however, it actually became a project I enjoyed. I had fun mixing the sounds, moving them and arranging them until I was happy with the mix. At the beginning, I had a sound of a spaceship blasting into hyperdrive, and then mixed in sounds consisting of space swirls, outer space animals, a noise of a black hole void, and deep space. To me it has a big Star Wars feel. The sounds all merged together really well, and I was surprised at how well the clip turned out, considering it was my first time ever doing a project like that. My clip was a little over 60 seconds.</p>

        <p>2. An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audience</p>
        <p>An example of a choice I made related to genre is the design of my website. I chose to keep it professional and clean, with no flashy colors or fonts, and nothing that is too hard to read. If I had to reimagine this in a genre meant for kids, I would use brighter colors and add gifs and pictures to keep them interested. I would also make the font larger so it is easier for them to read if they are young. I would also consider creating a game to put on my website for them to play on, as right now my website is to showcase who I am and show my work, and there wouldn’t be a need for that on a kids site.</p>

        <p>3. An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode</p>
        <p>A design I made related to aspects of the visual mode is my logo brand. I created a logo for a fake company called Rose Bakery. I used flowers around the logo, and used a pink hue. The concept I was going for was simple and sweet, and the pink represented that very well.  If I were to create a logo for a more serious brand, like say a law firm, I would keep the design very simple. I would use black and white for my colors, a calligraphy font, and there would be no frilly design around the logo that wouldn’t cause the firm to be taken seriously.</p>
