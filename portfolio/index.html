        <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>This is the final version of my website and portfolio for this class, and I am quite pleased with, and proud of myself. When I first started in January, I had absolutely no knowledge of html, css, photoshop, or audacity. Now I can proudly say I have mastered the basics of all four of these categories, and completed assignments for them. My website has gone from empty and un-organized, to a cohesive design concept and filled with completed projects. I hope to use the website as an extension of my portfolio for future employers. I think they will find it professional, clean, and easy to navigate. In ‘Creating Your Own Showcase,’ Carolyn Handler Miller writes “A well thought out 'calling card' of original work illustrates what your special talents are, where your creative leanings lie, and also reveals something about who you are as a person.” I feel my digital portfolio shows my creativity as well as who I am, so I think my website is on the right track.</p>
        <p>The area I struggled the most with this semester was working with photoshop. I had never used it before, and felt like everyone else understood it more than I did. When we switched to virtual learning due to COVID-19 and had to complete the photoshop unit on our own at home, I felt even more behind. From computer problems to losing work saved at school, it was a challenge. Out of the four photoshop assignments, my favorite one is the very first one, where we took an old ad and turned it into a parody or satire. I didn’t do much to mine but erase text and add my own, but it was the first photoshop creation I’d ever made and I like my finished project. For the soundscape assignment, I just went with a sci-fi/outer space theme, mixing up noises such as spaceships blasting off and space swirls. The audacity assignment was surprisingly easy for me to do, and I found I genuinely had fun with it. I definitely enjoyed audacity more than Photoshop, and wish we’d been able to spend more time on it.</p> 
        <p>One of the things I consider to be the most important part of my writing process is outlining. No matter what the assignment is, I always outline what I will write before I start with the actual writing. For projects with multiple components, I create a checklist of everything that needs to be accomplished so that I am sure I am completing all aspects. I find this very important, and it helps me immensely. For this class and these projects, I have not changed this habit and it remains the most important part of my process. Creating an outline ensures I don’t leave out anything I may think of to include, and helps me organize my thoughts in a cohesive manner. I also find peer review to be an important part of the writing process. It has helped me learn to think through a different lens when I am writing, and another perspective is always helpful.</p>
        <p>A large part of my editing style is writing, stepping away from my work to reflect, and then going back into it with a fresh pair of eyes. This allows me to brain dump my work, and then think it over to see if there is a better way to convey my thoughts. Another pivotal part of my editing is spell checking. I tend to type or write fast so I don’t lose my train of thought, and often need to go back over my grammar and spelling. My approach to writing in different genres is to do my research before I actually start writing. I like to see how it is typically done, what the key components are, and how it is unique as a genre, and then start my writing. This is one of the reasons I liked the readings for the class so much, is they helped me get a sense for what we would be doing before we even started. My favorite reading for the semester was William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, and Jill Butler’s ‘Principles of Design’. It covered quite a lot of design concepts that would help us with our websites, and as I didn’t know any before coming into this class, it was a great resource for me. </p>
        <p>Some of the goals I had for my writing this semester largely lied in HTML, and learning how to write code. I can proudly say I have accomplished this goal, with a lot of help from my professor. I would like to continue working on the coding, especially playing around with CSS. Another thing I accomplished that I hadn’t even realized I wanted to work on was writing in different genres. Throughout the semester we played around with satires and parodies, looking at other’s works and creating our own.</p>
        <p>Overall I am extremely happy with how the semester turned out in regards to my work for this class. I learned quite a few skills that I hadn’t known that I know will serve me well when it comes to graduating and finding a job. At the beginning of the semester I was feeling hopeless, and didn't understand how I was going to learn anything when I was so bad at digital media from the start. When COVID-19 hit and we all switched to remote learning, that was another blow because I had less access to help. My professor was very patient with me all semester, helping me with everything and not losing his patience when I couldn’t grasp something. Now here we are at the end of the semester, and I would definitely call this semester a success.</p>
        <h3>Showcases and Reflections</h3>
        <p>1. Soundscape Activity</p>
          <p>For my soundscape, I chose to create something with a sci-fi/outer space element. I had never used Audacity before, so trying to learn how to use it remotely was slightly overwhelming for me at first. Once I got the hang of it, however, it actually became a project I enjoyed. I had fun mixing the sounds, moving them and arranging them until I was happy with the mix. At the beginning, I had a sound of a spaceship blasting into hyperdrive, and then mixed in sounds consisting of space swirls, outer space animals, a noise of a black hole void, and deep space. To me it has a big Star Wars feel. The sounds all merged together really well, and I was surprised at how well the clip turned out, considering it was my first time ever doing a project like that. My clip was a little over 60 seconds.</p>

        <p>2. An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audience</p>
        <p>An example of a choice I made related to genre is the design of my website. I chose to keep it professional and clean, with no flashy colors or fonts, and nothing that is too hard to read. If I had to reimagine this in a genre meant for kids, I would use brighter colors and add gifs and pictures to keep them interested. I would also make the font larger so it is easier for them to read if they are young. I would also consider creating a game to put on my website for them to play on, as right now my website is to showcase who I am and show my work, and there wouldn’t be a need for that on a kids site.</p>

        <p>3. An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode</p>
        <p>A design I made related to aspects of the visual mode is my logo brand. I created a logo for a fake company called Rose Bakery. I used flowers around the logo, and used a pink hue. The concept I was going for was simple and sweet, and the pink represented that very well.  If I were to create a logo for a more serious brand, like say a law firm, I would keep the design very simple. I would use black and white for my colors, a calligraphy font, and there would be no frilly design around the logo that wouldn’t cause the firm to be taken seriously.</p>

        <p>4. An example of how you made a choice related to comparing one thing to another</p>
        <p>A choice I made for comparison was the original design concept for my website versus my final design concept. I originally had red, dark gray, color gradients, and other wild choices because I wanted my website to stand out. It didn’t actually look that great, however, so I changed it to the one I have now, a clean, simple, professional layout. I think another revision that would be good is adding pictures to my bio now that I have the ability to do that, as I didn’t know how when I made the first design concept for my webpage. I don’t have a photo of my original design.</p>

        <p>5. An example of something that frustrated you or took a larger amount of time than you would have liked</p>
        <p>Something that frustrated me and took more time than I would have liked was my storyboard creation on photoshop. First, after transitioning to virtual learning and leaving campus, I was unable to access the storyboard I had finished and had to start from scratch. I have also never used photoshop before, and felt like I was behind all of my classmates who already knew how to use it. I was overwhelmed and struggling with this assignment. Eventually, after watching many tutorials,  I was able to figure out the basics enough to complete the storyboard to my satisfaction.</p>

        <p>6. An example of something you are particularly proud of</p>
        <p>A project I really like is the photoshop genre swap assignment. We worked in groups for this assignment, which I enjoyed. We had to take a comedy movie poster, and turn it into a superhero movie. We chose the film Step Brothers, and photoshopped Thor and Loki onto it. I liked working in groups for this assignment because we were all able to contribute, and if someone was confused or didn’t understand something, there were other people able to help out. I prefer this to trying to figure everything out on my own and being lost. For future digital media work, I would like to continue working with the team of people.</p>
