        <p>1. Soundscape Activity
          For my soundscape, I chose to create something with a sci-fi/outer space element. I had never used Audacity before, so trying to learn how to use it remotely was slightly overwhelming for me at first. Once I got the hang of it, however, it actually became a project I enjoyed. I had fun mixing the sounds, moving them and arranging them until I was happy with the mix. At the beginning, I had a sound of a spaceship blasting into hyperdrive, and then mixed in sounds consisting of space swirls, outer space animals, a noise of a black hole void, and deep space. To me it has a big Star Wars feel. The sounds all merged together really well, and I was surprised at how well the clip turned out, considering it was my first time ever doing a project like that. My clip was a little over 60 seconds.</p>
