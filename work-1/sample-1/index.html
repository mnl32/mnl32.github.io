    <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
    <p>0/5 Stars! I bought this stuffed animal for my 6-year-old daughter Olivia as a cute little Christmas present. She absolutely LOVED it and takes it everywhere with her. The day after Christmas, however, the stuffed bear started seeming a little off. She left it in the living room that night after she had gone to bed and asked me to go get it. I left the room to go grab it but couldn’t find iton the couch where we had left it for bath-time. When I went to tell Olivia that I couldn’t find the bear, it was already in bed with her! Olivia claims it came to her like magic because it missed her. Obviously, I didn’t believe her, but just assumed that she had grabbed it from the living room and forgot. However, things started getting even weirder. That bear never seemed far away from her. Even if I saw her put it down somewhere, it would mysteriously be in her arms 5 minutes later, despite the fact that she never went over to pick it up. It’s like it magically attached itself to my daughter. It also has the creepiest eyes. It’s like they’re real! They follow you, always watching whatever you do. It’s like if the Mona Lisa eyes were put in a doll. Here is the kicker, though! The worst part! Yesterday, I walked over to my daughter to pick it up, and the bear HISSED at me. I swear to god it did. Olivia insists she didn’t hear anything, but I promise you that stuffed bear is a devil’s object. As soon as Olivia went to bed last night, I grabbed that bear from her and threw it in the fireplace. We do not need any Satanical objects in my house. DO NOT buy this bear for your kids.</p>
