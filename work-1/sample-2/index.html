    <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
    <p>Original:For my design, I will probably go with a professional and calm layout, maybe with a splash of color so it doesn’t seem too incredibly serious. I think the layout of a website depends on the audience. Blogs, who’s intended audiences are usually teens or young adults, and aren’t intended to be very serious, usually involve more colors, designs, and pictures. Websites that are intended as a type of resume are typically less intense, more professional looking, and not as many designs or colors. I enjoy websites that aren’t very dull and serious looking, typically more like blogs and interactive types. My website design will most likely be black and white with a splash of color (probably my name), with options to click links to other pages on the website such as about me and contact me. The font will probably not be times new roman, but still an easily readable font.
      Revision:My design is a webpage that could be used in a professional setting but has hints of boldness in a way that subtly sticks out. I plan to use a red font color for the title, with some sort of gradient going from dark to light red. The title font will be big, so it stands out, along with the red. I want the menu to be centered and linear, going down instead of the typical, across the top menu. The background won’t be white, but it’ll be some shade of off white that catches attention without being too annoying to look at. I’d like to have some sort of hover color that compliments the red of the title. I don’t know which font I’d like the webpage to have, but probably one that is easy to read when the font is colored. </p>
