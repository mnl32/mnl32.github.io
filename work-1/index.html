    <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
    <p>Before this class, I had never had any experience with any sort of website design or coding. My roommate has taken a few computer design classes and encouraged me to take this one, convincing me it was a useful skill I’d be glad to know. After the first few weeks, it is evident that coding is not my calling in life. I have, however, learned more than I ever thought I would. At this point in the class, I can do basic coding to build a website, as well as basic CSS to design and style it. 
	A lot of my work on my webpage was trial and error, with plenty of error. I used the website W3Schools for a lot of the coding for my CSS page, with the individual design. It has a function where you can test out different codes and it shows you what it looks like, then when you create a design you like you can copy and paste the coding into your actual website. I also utilized Professor Lavin’s office hours for help, when I truly didn’t know what I was doing, or I was stuck somewhere and didn’t know how to move forward. My biggest issue with my webpage ended up being figuring out a design concept. I didn’t know what that meant, and I didn’t know how to come up with something that wasn’t the basic “oh I want a clean and simple design.” I didn’t have any specific attributes I wanted, and I didn’t know what kind of concept I was going to create for my page. After attending office hours and working through it, I eventually settled on a concept that could still be used in a professional setting, but still shows touches of bold/loudness, such as through the font colors. I settled on a red gradient for the font, against an off-white, silver background. 
Another problem I encountered while designing my webpage was not giving up when I got repeatedly frustrated by my lack of computer skills, especially when it seemed like everyone else in class was having more success than I was. Eventually, with a lot of trial and error and help from both my professor and my computer-savvy roommate, I started to figure out what was working and what wasn’t and focus on the areas I was really struggling with. This area ended up being the CSS portion. I got the basics, such as background color and font color, but styling the menu page and figuring out how to change the hover color was more difficult.
In terms of revision for my work, in terms of the design concept and embedded fiction assignments, those revisions were just going back and looking at them with a fresh perspective. Going back and revising them outside of class, where it’s not something I have to finish in the next 45 minutes. The design concept especially, going back and looking at them after a few more class periods and actually learning what a design concept is supposed to be, and what that entails made it a lot better. Revision for a lot of the coding meant trying it, seeing that it didn’t actually work for the webpage, and going back to try and figure out what part of the code was wrong. The biggest part of this was trying to link my submenu to the main menu, and trying to figure out why it wouldn’t work like everything else, so I had to change the code.
	To continue my work on my website, I think I would like to continue playing around with the layout of my main-menu and add photos. I would like to learn how to manipulate photos in photoshop, as well as learn how to use photoshop in general. I would also like to learn how to add and manipulate animation on a webpage, and the coding that goes into those designs. In terms of growth, I’d like to continue learning how web designers design webpage concepts in terms of audience, which is something we have already started learning to work on our own webpages. 
	Overall, I would say my progress in the class is slow but steady. I still have a lot to learn, but I’ve already learned more than I thought I would know. I can comfortably set up a website through Github, as well as implement some basic CSS design into it. This is only the first Work-In-Progress, so by the next one I will have learned even more design principles and coding to continue building my webpage.
